<h3>Reddit</h3>
The first app I chose to look at was the official Reddit app. Reddit is a micro blogging website which has established itself as one of the most popular websites in the world, and holds the self-proclaimed title of the “Front page of the internet”. Although Reddit has been around for a long time as a website, their official app was released on April 6th, 2016. Before the official Reddit app was released, you either had to use third-party apps, or your phones browser to browse Reddit on mobile devices. However, now that Reddit has released an official app, it allows them to provide a much more optimized experience for their mobile users. 

I chose this application because I use both the application and the website frequently, and was curious about analyzing it from a usability perspective. The main selling point of the app is that it provides a much more customizable and optimized Reddit experience on mobile devices then was previously available to users. Another advantage is that it allows new features added to the website to be simultaneously available to mobile users, as it is the official Reddit app, and third-party Reddit apps would likely take a lot longer to implement the new features into their apps. 

Another great thing about the app is that it is highly customizable, and you can subscribe to different “Subreddits”, which are forums dedicated to specific topics on Reddit. Subscribing to a subreddit means you will see posts from the subreddit on your home page, as opposed to just the popular posts across all the subreddits. This adds to the customizability the app provides, and is one of the main selling points behind Reddit. 

However, there are a few things about the app which I do not like. The first and foremost being how it sends you push notifications about seemingly random posts on the front page, even if you are not subscribed to that subreddit. Although this can be disabled, it is enabled by default, and requires some digging to find the option to disable the push notification. I feel that this should be changed to either have the option easier to find, only send notifications about posts from subreddits you are subscribed to, or not have it enabled by default. Lastly, another thing I dislike about the app is the UI, I think it is cluttered, and is not very minimalistic. A UI change to incorporate a more minimalistic and less clutter would be a much-needed improvement. </p>

<p><h3>Receipt Hog</h3>
The second app I chose to look at is Receipt Hog. Receipt Hog is an app created by the research marketing company InfoScout, for the purpose of collecting data on users spending habits. The main selling point of the app is that it allows you to earn a small amount of money by uploading your shopping receipts to the application. They also have daily, weekly, and monthly rewards to encourage users to keep using the app, and to keep uploading their receipts to earn bigger and better rewards the longer they use the app. 

I chose this app because I think it is a good idea for an app, and a win-win situation for both parties involved. The most prominent of reasons as to why users would use this app is that it pays you to upload a picture of your shopping receipts in order to earn money, and it is a good way to slowly accumulate money for doing something as easy as taking a picture of a receipt, which most people discard anyways. One thing I dislike about the application is that if you swipe left on an announcement, it shows a delete button to delete the announcement, however the delete button does not currently work on my device. Instead, you have to take a few extra steps to click on the announcement, scroll to the bottom, then delete the announcement. Something else I dislike about the app is the UI, and the lack of customization to remove the very cluttered and pushy looking interface. 

On the main page, there is a button in the bottom-middle of the screen which allows you to take and upload a picture of a receipt. However, for new users that have not uploaded any receipts, there is a toast above that button saying to add your first receipt, and it is awful because it gets in the way of elements of the UI, and is not dismissible. This should be changed so that the toast is at least dismissible, as it makes it hard to see some other features of the UI with the non-dismissible toast.</p>
